a Control voltage interface for your DAW
====================================================

General idea
------------
I was tinkering with some eurorack style DIY synth modules when I came across the issue of not being able to reliably tune my oscillators. I needed a simple way to get definitive musical notes generated by my DAW or a midi keyboard converted to a control voltage.

Implementation:
--------------

To implement this I used the DAC0808 8-bit digital to analog converter, an arduino nano (chinese knock-off board), an 74ls273 octal flip flop and an operational amplifier (TL072 or equivalent). On the software side I based my code partly on [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGfqwg_r5ig) video by RHelectronics and modified and added to it to work with the DAC0808. The Flipflop is used to provide an extra layer of buffering to the arduino outputs since these can be noisy and mess with the DAC (or so I have heard so maybe its utterly unnecassary). The arduino ouputs go (after buffering) straight to the binary inputs of the DAC. The operational amplifier is configured as a transimpedance amplifier to convert the output current of the DAC to a usable control voltage (0-5V).

**Code and software**

The code running on the arduino is pretty simple. It listens for incoming serial communication, decodes the midi messages and (depending on the note value detected) switches on and of the output pins. The external software used is [hairlessMidi](https://projectgus.github.io/hairless-midiserial/#downloads), a simple yet powerful tool to send midi data via serial communication to the arduino board. Depending on what is used to generate the midi data another useful tool might be [loopMidi](https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html). This program provides an easy way to virtually connect midi channels on your device.

**Example setup 1 (midi Keyboard):**

The midi keyboard is selected as midi input and the serial port associated with the arduino is selected as output. Note that the displayed messages in hairlessMidi can be really useful for debugging.

**Example setup 2 (loopMidi):**

The loopMidi channel is selected as midi input and the serial port associated with the arduino is selected as output. Now the same loopMidi channel can be set as a midi output in your DAW or sequencing software.
