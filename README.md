a Control voltage interface for your DAW
====================================================

General idea
------------
I was tinkering with some eurorack style DIY synth modules when I came across the issue of not being able to reliably tune my oscillators. I needed a simple way to get definitive musical notes generated by my DAW or a midi keyboard converted to a control voltage.

To implement this I used the DAC0808 8-bit digital to analog converter, an arduino nano (chinese knock-off board), an 74ls273 octal flip flop and an operational amplifier (TL072 or equivalent) for buffering. On the software side I based my code partly on [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGfqwg_r5ig) video by RHelectronics and modified and added to it to work with the DAC0808.
